- 👋 Hi, I’m @eastonprodav
- 👀 I’m interested in analytics! all of it. Healthcare, Sports, molecular biology, global health, and public policy are my current jams. I love diving into these concepts and telling important stories that contribute to our human enterprise. I also enjoy other things like biking, cooking, comedy, coffee, and ESPECIALLY a good hang with friends. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of it. again. R, Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau. I'm new to data science!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can get me some of that good experience!
- 📫 How to reach me: eleed15@gmail.com
